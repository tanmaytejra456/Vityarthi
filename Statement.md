Problem Statement :- 
The goal is to create a portable, integrated desktop tool for critical real estate tasks like finding a good broker , calculating tax , generating rental agreement and evaluating property's valuation.  The tool must provide accurate financial calculations, secure contact management, and standardized legal documentation generation, all within a focused, efficient desktop application environment.

Scope of the Project:- 
This project, the "Property analyser," is a standalone desktop application built entirely with Python and Tkinter. The scope includes three core modules: financial calculations (land value and tax), contacting brokers arounf you , and document generation (rental agreement).

Target users:-
1. Individual Property Owners/Managers: Requires a simple, offline application for recurring financial calculations and agreement generation.
2. Small Real Estate Agents: Needs a private, local tool to manage broker/client contacts without relying on internet access or complex databases.
3. Students/Academics: Demonstrates a practical application of Python GUI development, data structures, and file I/O for persistent storage.

High-level features:-
1. Land Value Calculator: Calculates total value based on area and price per unit.
2. Broker Contact Management : Users can Add, View, and Delete broker contacts.
3. Rental Agreement Generator: Creates a structured, standardized rental agreement text based on user-provided property and financial details.
